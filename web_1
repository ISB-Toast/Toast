								<h2>WHAT IS MINWCRAFT MOD?</h2>
								<p>A Minecraft mod is an independent, user-made modification to the Mojang video game Minecraft. Tens of thousands of these mods exist, and users can download them from the internet commonly for free. Utilizing additional software, several mods are typically able to be used at the same time in order to enhance gameplay.
									Minecraft mods are available for computer and mobile versions of the game, but legacy console versions cannot be modded with practical methods.</p>

								<h2>MOD CONTENT</h2>
								<p>The total number of Minecraft mods is hard to calculate because of how numerous they are. One repository website, CurseForge, features over 100,000 mods as of March 2022.
									The types and sorts of content added by these modifications also take on many different forms.
									Technology mods are mods that adds an assortment of machines that can help the player to automate the production of certain in-game materials. Examples of technology-oriented mods include Extra Utilities, a mod that introduces various machines that can be used to generate power, and a random assortment of other blocks and items; BuildCraft, a classic mod known for its many variants of machines, pumps, and pipes; and IndustrialCraft, a mod which adds metals, electric tools, generators, including nuclear reactors, jetpacks, powered armor, and nuclear items. Its power system also tries to mimic real life electrical circuits in an intuitive way.
									In addition to IndustrialCraft's metal weapons, other projects allow for an even wider range of available weaponry: Flan's Mod has modern-style warfare including guns, tanks and grenades, while Tinkers' Construct allows players to forge and customize their own tools and weapons, some involving a foundry or a forge.
									Other mods attempt to customize the natural elements in Minecraft, with mods like Natura and Forestry adding new trees and crops, with the latter adding multiblock automatic farms, beekeeping and butterfly-keeping. Mo' Creatures, on the other hand, focuses rather on allowing more animal species into Minecraft, while Pixelmon supplements the game with monsters and mechanics such as battling, catching, and gyms from the Pokémon franchise. Fossils & Archaeology provides for dinosaurs, while CustomNPCs and Millenaire upgrade the game's NPC's.
									There are also mods that add new dimensions that can be visited by the player. The Galacticraft mod allows players to build rockets in order to fly to the Moon and several planets, and collect their resources and Twilight Forest creates a dimension that enables players to explore a fantasy-style forest and hunt for treasures.
									Not all mods will add gameplay elements, however. Others merely tweak the GUI, for example by adding a minimap, try to smoothen the game rendering, like OptiFine, or by allowing the player to browse through all the items in both the base game and the player's mods and look up how to craft them, like JEI (Just Enough Items).
									OptiFine is the most popular Minecraft mod. It decreases the computer resource usage of the game and adds support for installable “shader packs” to Minecraft. These shader packs can completely change the game look by adding shadows, dynamic lights, reflective surfaces, and other effects. Some shaders are even begging to implement more advanced features like ray tracing, physically based rendering, and parallax occlusion mapping into Java Edition. Most shaders are, however, very hardware-demanding.</p>

								<h2>MODPACKS</h2>
								<p>Mods are sometimes grouped together in so-called "modpacks", which can be easily downloaded and played by the end user without requiring the player to have extensive knowledge on how to set up the game. Content creators (modpack developers) use that to their advantage in order to allow mods to interact (alter the vanilla gameplay) so that a particular experience can be delivered, sometimes aided by throwing configuration files and custom textures into the mix. The most popular modpacks can be downloaded and installed through launchers, like Feed the Beast, Technic Launcher, ATLauncher and CurseForge Desktop App.</p>

								<h2>OFFICIAL SUPPORT</h2>
								<p>In 2012, Mojang said they were starting work on a repository for Minecraft mods. Their help website lists video tutorials that teach the player how to install and play Minecraft mods.

									Minecraft's creator Markus Persson admitted in 2012 that he was initially skeptical of mods, fearing that the user-made content would threaten his vision for the game. Persson says he came around, as he claims to have realized that mods are "a huge reason of what Minecraft is". In some cases, authors of mods even ended up getting a job at Mojang, and some in-game features, such as pistons and horses, were originally from mods.
									
									In 2016, Mojang announced their official support for mods for the Bedrock version of Minecraft, where they are known as "add-ons".</p>

							<h2>EDUCATIONAL</h2>
							<p>Minecraft mods are credited for being a gateway for children to pick up coding and programming. Several educational projects have been created to further encourage students to learn coding through Minecraft, including LearnToMod, ComputerCraftEdu, and Minecraft: Pi Edition, all of which are offered free to teachers. Programming classes utilizing Minecraft were also started by the University of California, which aims to teach children aged 8–18 how to program applications.

								In 2011, MinecraftEdu formed to sell a version of Minecraft to schools that enabled the teaching of a wider variety of subjects including language, history and art. In January 2016, Microsoft announced a new tool, "Minecraft: Education Edition", which would be designed specifically for classroom use and which would continue on the legacy of "MinecraftEdu" to teach a wide variety of subjects using Minecraft.
								
								In The Parent's Guidebook to Minecraft, author Cori Dusmann denotes that homeschooling and Minecraft make for an interesting match, as creating simple mods can be an "illustration of scientific principles," to which homeschooling providers are receptive.
								
								The idea of introducing Minecraft into school curriculums was resisted by Tom Bennett, who serves as an adviser to the British government. According to Bennett, Minecraft was a gimmick, and schools would do well to "drain the swamp of gimmicks" and resort to just books for teaching. Bennett's condemnation was rebutted by a number of journalists for The Guardian, who thought that Minecraft in schools was a worthwhile innovation.</p>
